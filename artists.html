                    <h5 style="position: absolute; left: 6%; top: 25%;">Justin Drew Bieber is a Canadian singer. He was
                        discovered by American record executive Scooter Braun and
                        signed with RBMG Records in 2008, gaining recognition with the release of his debut EP My World
                        (2009). It reached number six on the US Billboard 200, while its singles "One Time" and "One
                        Less Lonely Girl" peaked in the top twenty on the Billboard Hot 100. <br>
                        Bieber's debut studio album, My World 2.0 (2010), debuted atop the Billboard 200, making him the
                        youngest solo male act to top the chart in 47 years. The album also contained the
                        internationally successful single "Baby", and established him as a teen idol. His second
                        album, Under the Mistletoe (2011), was the first Christmas album by a male artist to debut at
                        number one on the Billboard 200, while his third album, Believe (2012), saw experimentation
                        with dance-pop and mature themes. Following Believe, Bieber's public image went through a
                        drastic change through various controversies and legal issues during 2013 and 2014, leading
                        to Rolling Stone dubbing him "Bad Boy" on their March 2014 issue.</h5>
